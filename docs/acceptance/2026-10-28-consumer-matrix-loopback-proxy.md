# Installed-consumer acceptance matrix after the loopback proxy bind, 2026-10-28

Produced by `scripts/acceptance-matrix.sh --consumer`: the tarball ships the patch with the loopback proxy bind, the consumer declares it before the first install, and the installed runner refuses an unpatched bundle. Every row passed, including `loopback-only-listeners`.

mode: consumer; platform: Linux x86_64; bun 1.2.19; node v22.22.0; ckb-verify 0.0.2; project HEAD 65bd99dc51373308721c6b446e8becd0476fb90e; 2026-10-28T20:30:59Z
